/**
 * The composite pattern is meant to allow treating individual objects and compositions of objects, or “composites” in the same way.
 *
 * Advantage of Composite Design Pattern
 *     It defines class hierarchies that contain primitive and complex objects.
 *     It makes easier to you to add new kinds of components.
 *     It provides flexibility of structure with manageable class or interface.
 *
 * Usage of Composite Pattern
 *  It is used:
 *     When you want to represent a full or partial hierarchy of objects.
 *     When the responsibilities are needed to be added dynamically to the individual objects without affecting other objects. Where the responsibility of object may vary from time to time.
